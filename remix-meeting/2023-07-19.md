## Remix Meeting
#### Remix Docs
The markdown files are updated, but the pot files are not. Please update the pot files, so that we can translate on crowdin.

#### Pull Requests
This one was submitted by @brucexu-eth . I told you several weeks ago. But still, no one is handling it.

#### Tips Videos
I just found out that mocca has a youtube channel -- https://www.youtube.com/@wushuanginvestment/videos

He made a lot of videos before, and he also knows how to edit videos, just simple operations, but that should be enough.

I told him about the tips videos, and he's very interesting. He will make a few videos, then we can discuss about the payment.

Last year, I sent you two videos, `Using Remixd` and `Using remix & ganache`. I see you posted `Using Remixd` on youtube.

**What about the other one? Is there any problem?**

Anyway, I think we can do more than what I did last year. I mean you still need to add the intakes and outtakes, and put english voice in the videos. I suppose we can do it for you. I mean we're already making the videos, why don't we make it perfect.

#### Mirror sites
I deployed these mirror sites two months ago. We're keeping maintaining them.

If you have a wechat account, it will be very convenient to catch up our updates.

#### Proposal
In order to make this meeting more efficient, I suppose we can send each other a brief before the meeting. It does not have to be detailed, just list some subjects that we would like to talk about. So that we can be more prepared.

And we can discuss on telegram first if some subjects are not clear.

I will update the brief after the meeting, just keep a record, in case anyone want to review the meeting.
